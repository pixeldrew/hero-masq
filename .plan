refactor StaticHosts.leaseExpiry to StaticHosts.Expiry makes more sense since we're also using StaticHosts for a records
increase unit test coverage
add more dnsmasq options (which ones?)
	txt-record
    auth-zone
	mx-host
add i18n support
add a more user friendly interface (tooltips, better layout for mobile)
log output to syslog
send SIGUSR1 to dnsmasq then view log output that displays cache information
add a way to delete a lease (infinite leases are stuck)
put a note about dhcp leasetimes that they shouldn't be less than an hour
increase documentation on docker deployment
	show examples on how to use docker-compose with dnscrypt-proxy
	give examples on how to configure dnsmasq
look for a way to include certbot dns challange support in docker build for ssl
investigate graphql authentication and authorization using schema directives to allow for a finer grained ACL
investigate writing an AST for dnsmasq config so I don't have to write a json file and work with existing configurations


defects:
sighup doesn't reload configuration files
		remedy: static hosts go to addnhosts file and dhcp-hosts go to dhcp-hostsfile
problems:
	have to restart dnsmasq when dhcp range or domain and is updated
